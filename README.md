# Devs-100-Ways-Of-Code-Playground

> This repository contains code of diiferent Algorithms.
If you are interested in learning Algorithms and how to write efficent code using different programming approaches join us. 

> Look how you can contribute here [Contribution Guidelines](#contribution-guidelines-gear) 

# Contribution Guidelines

You may go through these guidelines and contribute accordingly:

* Make sure you do not copy codes from external sources like GFG, hackerearth, etc because that work will not be considered. **Plagiarism is strictly not allowed.** 
* You can only work on issues that you have been assigned to you.
* If you want to contribute for an existing algorithm, we prefer that you create an issue before making a PR and link your PR to that issue.
* If you have modified/added code work, make sure the code compiles before submitting.
* Strictly use snake_case (underscore_separated) in your file_name and push it in correct folder.
* Just mention the issue against which the pull request is open by writing ```Fixes #(your issue number)``` in the description of the pull request
* Do not update the [README.md](README.md).
* Do not push any changes in the main branch. Always make a new branch with the number assosiated with you issue.
* Refer [Devs-Git-Cheatsheet](https://github.com/Devs-Paradise/Devs-Git-Cheatsheet) in order to learn how to create new branch, fix any error etc.


# When You Write Code
* Explain question in detail above your code with proper input and output using multiline comments.
* Do not write your whole code in main function.
* Break codes in as many as meaningful functions as possible.
* Write proper comments to make your code meaningful and understandable.
* Give meaningful name to variables and functions.
